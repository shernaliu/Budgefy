This project is a Android mobile application developed by myself, Kai Ling, Rachel for the module Mobile Application (ST0281) during our time in SP - DIT in 2016.

The mobile application (app) developed by our team is a personal expense tracking app called “Budgefy”. The objective of Budgefy is to provide users a more efficient way of tracking expenses.

The main target audience for Budgefy is adults. From our user research, many adults face difficulty in cultivating the habit of keeping track of personal expenses. It is challenging to be frugal in this day and age due to excessive consumerism. More often than enough, money is spent incessantly, excessively and frivolously without concern nor regard whether it is a justified
purchase.

Based on our user research, the two traditional methods of recording one’s expenses are:
1. Manually writing down by hand using paper and pen
2. Microsoft Excel sheets

Although these traditional methods accomplish the same goal of tracking expenses, it is actually counter-productive in the long-run. Due to the sheer amount of expense data, It is too tedious to manually calculate it daily. Hence, it requires one to expend considerable amount of time and effort to maintain such archaic records. This results in a situation whereby some people simply
forgo the habit of tracking expense altogether.

Budgefy streamlines the arduous and repetitive process of recording one’s daily expenses. Users can access this Android app ubiquitously to take a photo of a receipt to instantly generate and store an expense record.

Bufgefy utilises a technology called Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which is used to extract text from a receipt image. Budgefy processes the extracted data to identify information such as merchant name, total amount spent and date. Furthermore, it calculates and displays an expense summary to give user an overview of their spending.

Functionalities:

- Splash Screen and Log In 
-  Add Receipt Record via Camera
- View Receipt Records and Details 
- Update Receipt Record
- Delete Receipt Record
- Add Receipt Record via Gallery
- Add Receipt Record via Manual Input
- View Expense Summary
- About tab and Email Feedback
- Logout

This project uses the [OCRSpace OCR API](https://ocr.space).
